Task3: Car Price Prediction Project

I developed a model to predict car prices based on various factors.Leveraging the "CarPrice" dataset, I utilized data preprocessing, visualization, and Linear Regression to achieve accurate predictions.
Key Highlights:
✅ Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values and converted categorical data to numerical representations.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis: Utilized visualizations to gain insights into feature correlations and distributions.
✅ pycaret Regression: Developed a predictive model to estimate car prices.
✅ Evaluation Metrics: Assessed model performance using MSE, RMSE, and R-squared values.

Results & Future Prospects:
The  Extra Trees Regressor model showed promising accuracy, providing valuable insights into factors impacting car prices. In the future, I plan to explore advanced algorithms and feature engineering techniques to enhance prediction capabilities
